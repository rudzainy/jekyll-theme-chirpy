The logo encapsulates various maritime symbols, underscoring its seafaring essence.

Ropes, fundamental on any vessel, demand precise knotting for safety. The endless loop of the rope signifies members intertwining to fortify and safeguard the association.

The lifebuoy bearing the Persatuan Maritim Malaysia name signifies the association as a trusted resource and sanctuary for its members.

At the heart of the logo, the North Star serves as a poignant reminder of the association's missionâ€”a guiding light for members navigating uncertain waters.
