description: Hoojah is an online poll & debating site. It’s a pet project that I have been working on since 2013. People can go to the platform, create polls and vote for other polls. They can also engage with other users through one-on-one debate.

### The Inefficiency of Online Discussion Platforms

Today Malaysians go to social media platforms and online forums to discuss things that matters to them. It’s hard to keep track of a specific topic on social media platforms because different group of people discuss the same topics separately, hence failed to provide structural opinions and results. While online forum still uses old layout.

Subjective discussions make it hard for people to make decisions and eventually become noises. People need to process those discussion before come up with a point. Open polls is an objective question that could  deter the users to discuss the topic subjectively.

And the open poll mechanism, while is created by the discussion initiator and answers are provided to respondents has limited options and could create frustration to the respondents if the answers are not based on their opinion.
Having high engagement in the topics doesn’t mean you’re getting a lot out of it. Numbers of engagement  could be self-explanatory therefore, the outcome of the discussion is subjective.

These platforms rarely filter out their users, so a user can register multiple accounts and manipulate the discussion.

### Hoojah's Objective

1. To become a platform for Malaysians to have structured objective discussions online. Every new arguments posted will be tied to a poll which only has three options: agree, neutral or disagree.

2. Encourage users to respond to other users’ arguments objectively to promote quality discussions. Thus, encourage ethical online discussion.

3. Create a trustworthy space in the Internet for Malaysians by verifying user’s identity and eliminate the noises in online discussion environment.

A one-on-one debate page (seems to be getting good traction, probably because of the two well known public figure debating... interesting stuff)

The log in and sign up feature is combined into a single page. Log in takes priority over sign up, therefore on mobile, the sign up form would be pushed down.

Registered users can create new polls with some options for customization.

Alternative design of user profile page with badges. The idea for badges came from the need to group user interests together, where a badge could be affiliated with user groups, active categories or user achievements.
