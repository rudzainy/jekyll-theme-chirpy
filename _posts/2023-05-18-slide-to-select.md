## The Problem


![Slide to select](/assets/img/posts/tap-to-select.png)

- objects moving too fast
- too may taps
- can exclude tapping send?
  - can but how if accidental tap?
- 


## Sliding instead of tapping

- can remove send button
- slider control to allow unselect

## what happened?

- too much cost to build for a proof of concept
